# RUMBA32

RUMBA32 is a 32-bit version of the RUMBA 3D Printer control board. RUMBA32 is derived from the Aus3D [RUMBA+](https://github.com/Aus3D/RUMBA-Plus) design, which is an overhauled version of the original RUMBA.

RUMBA32 combines the improved RUMBA+ design with a powerful 32-bit STM32F446 microcontroller.

RUMBA32 is currently under active development. Some details here are not final and may be subject to change. Once the design has been finalised, boards will be available for sale in the [Aus3D shop](http://aus3d.com.au/rumba-plus). 

In keeping with the original RUMBA design, RUMBA32 is fully open source.
