# RUMBA32

RUMBA32 is a 32-bit version of the RUMBA 3D Printer control board. RUMBA32 is derived from the Aus3D [RUMBA+](https://github.com/Aus3D/RUMBA-Plus) design, which is an overhauled version of the original RUMBA.

RUMBA32 combines the improved RUMBA+ design with a powerful 32-bit STM32F446 microcontroller.

In keeping with the original RUMBA design, RUMBA32 is fully open source. RUMBA32 boards are available for sale in the [Aus3D shop](https://aus3d.com.au/rumba32). 

Instructions for uploading firmware can be found on the [Getting RUMBA32 Up and Running](https://github.com/Aus3D/RUMBA32/wiki/Getting-RUMBA32-Up-&-Running) wiki page.
